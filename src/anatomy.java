//For function to work we need them to be included within the class Main.
//Functions in Java work in similar ways as in C++.

//FILE NAME FOR A JAVA FILE SHOULD BE THE SAME AS THE NAME FOR THE DECLARED CLASS.
//AND THE DECLARED CLASS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE MAIN CLASS/METHOD.
//AND WHEN YOU WANT TO RUN THE CODE, YOU ALWAYS RUN THE FILE CONTAINING THE MAIN CLASS.

/*
class Main{
* return_type Name(){
*
* }
* OR
* void Name(){
* }
*}

// ALL THE INFORMATION WE NEED FOR A JAVA CODE/PROGRAM BEFORE WE START
// WITH THE DSA IMPLEMENTATION.
/*
* Certainly. I'll provide a more detailed explanation of the process and some additional information:

1. Writing the code:
   - Ensure your code is in a file named `Main.java`. The filename must match the class name (in this case, `Main`) and have the `.java` extension.

2. Compiling:
   - The `javac` command compiles your Java source code into bytecode.
   - Command: `javac Main.java`
   - If successful, this creates a `Main.class` file in the same directory.
   - If there are errors, the compiler will show them. Fix any errors and recompile.

3. Running:
   - The `java` command runs your compiled program.
   - Command: `java Main`
   - This starts the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and executes your program.

Additional information:

- Java Development Kit (JDK):
  - You need the JDK installed on your system to compile and run Java programs.
  - It includes the `javac` compiler and `java` runtime.

- Classpath:
  - If your program uses external libraries or multiple class files, you may need to set the classpath.
  - Use the `-cp` or `-classpath` option with the `java` command.

- Package declaration:
  - If your class is part of a package, the directory structure must match the package structure.
  - You'd need to compile and run the program slightly differently.

- IDEs:
  - Integrated Development Environments like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans can simplify this process.
  - They often handle compilation and running with a single click.
